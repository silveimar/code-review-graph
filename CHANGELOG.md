# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **File organization**: All generated files now live in `.code-review-graph/` directory instead of repo root
  - Auto-created `.gitignore` inside the directory prevents accidental commits
  - Automatic migration from legacy `.code-review-graph.db` at repo root
- **Visualization: start collapsed**: Only File nodes visible on load; click to expand children
- **Visualization: search bar**: Filter nodes by name or qualified name in real-time
- **Visualization: edge type toggles**: Click legend items to show/hide edge types (Calls, Imports, Inherits, Contains)
- **Visualization: scale-aware layout**: Force simulation adapts charge, distance, and decay for large graphs (300+ nodes)

### Changed
- Database path: `.code-review-graph.db` → `.code-review-graph/graph.db`
- HTML visualization path: `.code-review-graph.html` → `.code-review-graph/graph.html`
- `.code-review-graph/**` added to default ignore patterns (prevents self-indexing)

### Removed
- `references/` directory (duplicate of `docs/`, caused stale path references)
- `agents/` directory (unused, not wired into any code)
- `settings.json` at repo root (decorative, not loaded by code)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `serve` command: start MCP server directly from CLI

### Changed
- Comprehensive documentation overhaul across all reference files

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Universal installation: now works with `pip install code-review-graph[embeddings]` on Python 3.10+
- CLI entry point (`code-review-graph` command works after normal pip install)
- Clear Python version check with helpful Docker fallback for older Python users
- Improved README installation section with one-command + Docker option

### Changed
- Minimum Python requirement lowered from 3.11 → 3.10 (covers ~90% of users)
